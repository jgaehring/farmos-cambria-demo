# farmos-cambria-demo

A _super simple_ proof-of-concept for using Cambria lenses to convert a schema from farmOS 2.x servers to the local schema we'll be using in Field Kit 2.x.

Requires a local farmOS server (u: admin, p: admin), built with the latest 2.x Docker image, running alongside the Node script. The npm packages for `cambria` and `farmos` are pinned to the latest commits at the time of writing this.
